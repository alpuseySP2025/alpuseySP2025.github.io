## About Me
Hi! My name is Ammon. I graduated high school in 2021 and just returned from a 2 year mission for my church. I already do a lot of backend development with NodeJS and frontend with React, but I'm always looking to improve my skills. If you're interested in some of the things I've done in the past, you can check out my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/BobbyTheCatfish).
