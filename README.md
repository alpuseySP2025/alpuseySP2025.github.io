# About Me 👋
## My Interests 🧪
Hi! My name is Ammon. I graduated high school in 2021 and just returned from a 2 year mission for my church. I already do a lot of backend development with **NodeJS** and frontend with **React**, but I'm always looking to improve my skills. If you're interested in some of the things I've done in the past, you can check out my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/BobbyTheCatfish). I also enjoy photography, video making, playing instruments, and making mods for games.

## Website Reccomendations 🌐
- [Land Lines](https://lines.chromeexperiments.com/) is a website that takes a mouse movement and uses images from google maps to find a structure with a similar shape to the one you draw. It's an interesting application of machine learning and image recognition.
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) is a webapp for optimizing images so that they take up less data. It's really useful for making the images load faster on websites you make.
