        <h1>My name is Ammon</h1>
        <p>Hello! One of my favorite activities is listening to and playing music. One of my favorite music genres to listen to is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edc2yVHRHiQ">Jazz Fusion</a>.
        It's an interesting mix of jazz, funk, and a bit of rock, which somehow makes a perfect mix for me to study to.
        I also play trombone and a bit of piano and was in a local jazz pop band a few years ago.
        While I'm not planning on making music professionally, it's still a great hobby to have.</p>
